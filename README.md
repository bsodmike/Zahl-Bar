Developed in under 9 hours to fulfil a certain specification; this is still a work in progress.

## Running in development...

1. Run `bundle` to ensure you have the required dependencies

2. Run the migrations, `rake db:migrate`

3. Two rake tasks have been created to assist in (a) creating an admin user account and (b) seeing the database with sample data in lieu of the pending CRUD controller/views that are missing in the app.

4. Once both rake tasks have been executed, perform the following.

    User.last.update_attribute(:role,"admin")

5. [Download and install wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) and place the binary at `/usr/local/bin` &mdash; this is needed to allow downloading of PDFs from the application.

6. Fire up the development server via `rails s` and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
