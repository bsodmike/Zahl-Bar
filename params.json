Run `bundle install --without=production` to ensure you have the required dependencies.  This will create a `.bundle/config` file which will always force the skipping of any gems listed in the production group &mdash; this is done to skip the need for mysql as defined in the Gemfile.\r\n\r\n2. Run the migrations, `rake db:migrate`\r\n\r\n3. Two rake tasks have been created to assist in (a) creating an admin user account and (b) seeing the database with sample data in lieu of the pending CRUD controller/views that are missing in the app.\r\n\r\n4. Once both rake tasks have been executed, perform `User.last.update_attribute(:role,\"admin\")`\r\n\r\n5. [Download and install wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) and place the binary at `/usr/local/bin` &mdash; this is needed to allow downloading of PDFs from the application.\r\n\r\n6.
